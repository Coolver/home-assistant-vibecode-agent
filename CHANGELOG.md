# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.15] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Clipboard API error** - fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeText')"
  - Added fallback to legacy `document.execCommand('copy')` method
  - Works in non-HTTPS contexts (Home Assistant Ingress)
  - Graceful error handling with manual copy instructions
  - Copy button now works reliably in all browsers

### Technical
- Implemented smart clipboard detection: tries modern API → falls back to legacy
- Better error messages if both methods fail

## [1.0.14] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Consistent naming:** "API Key" → "Agent Key" throughout UI
  - Better alignment with `HA_AGENT_KEY` variable name
  - Clearer distinction from Home Assistant tokens
- **Simplified security info:** Removed technical details about SUPERVISOR_TOKEN
  - Less confusing for end users
  - Focused on what matters: "Agent Key authenticates you"

## [1.0.13] - 2025-11-08

### Improved
- **Copy button feedback** - better visual confirmation when copying
  - Button changes to "✅ Copied!" for 2 seconds
  - Button pulses on click
  - Center popup notification
  - Clear success/error states

### Fixed
- Copy button now has clear visual feedback (was not obvious before)

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Improved Ingress Panel UX** - complete redesign focused on user workflow
  - **Primary focus:** Ready-to-use JSON configuration (copy entire config)
  - **One-click copy:** "Copy Configuration to Clipboard" button
  - **Clear steps:** Step-by-step instructions for Cursor setup
  - **Advanced section:** API key view/regenerate moved to collapsed section
  - **Better flow:** User copies JSON → pastes → restarts Cursor → done!

### Added
- New `ingress_panel.py` module for cleaner HTML template management
- Advanced section with key visibility toggle
- Regenerate key button (UI prepared, backend TBD)

### UX Improvements
- No need to manually construct JSON - it's ready to copy
- Masked key by default in advanced section
- Clear visual hierarchy (config first, key details later)

## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Renamed environment variable** - `HA_TOKEN` → `HA_AGENT_KEY` (more accurate naming)
- **Backward compatible** - agent still accepts old `HA_TOKEN` name
- **Updated all documentation** - shows `HA_AGENT_KEY` in examples
- **Updated Ingress Panel** - displays `HA_AGENT_KEY` in setup instructions
- **Updated MCP client** - accepts both `HA_AGENT_KEY` and `HA_TOKEN`

### Migration
- **Recommended:** Update `~/.cursor/mcp.json` to use `HA_AGENT_KEY` instead of `HA_TOKEN`
- **Optional:** Old `HA_TOKEN` still works for backward compatibility

## [1.0.10] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Notification logic** - moved into get_or_generate_api_key() function
- Removed problematic `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator
- Fixed async context for notification sending
- Application now starts correctly with notification feature enabled

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-08

### 🔒 Security & UX Improvements

**Breaking Change:** API authentication changed from Home Assistant Long-Lived Token to dedicated API Key.

### Added
- **Dedicated API Key system** - separate from HA tokens
  - Auto-generates secure API key (32 bytes, cryptographically secure)
  - Optional: set custom API key in add-on configuration
  - Stored in `/config/.ha_cursor_agent_key`
- **Ingress Panel** - beautiful web UI in Home Assistant sidebar
  - Shows current API key (masked by default, click to reveal)
  - Copy to clipboard button
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Direct links to documentation
- **Optional notifications** - get notified when API key is generated
  - Configurable in add-on settings

### Changed
- **Authentication simplified** - no need to create HA Long-Lived Token
- **Ingress enabled** - panel appears in sidebar as "API Key"
- **Panel icon** changed to `mdi:key-variant`
- Agent now uses dedicated API key instead of user's HA token
- Agent still uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN internally for HA API operations

### Security
- ✅ No more transmitting HA Long-Lived Token over network
- ✅ API key is independent from HA authentication
- ✅ Can regenerate key without affecting HA access
- ✅ Simpler security model

### Migration
If upgrading from v1.0.8 or earlier:
1. Update add-on to v1.0.9
2. Open Sidebar → API Key (new panel will appear)
3. Copy your new API key
4. Update `~/.cursor/mcp.json` with new key
5. Restart Cursor

Old HA tokens will no longer work (this is intentional for security).

## [1.0.8] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **CLIMATE_CONTROL_BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Comprehensive guide with 10+ real-world edge cases
  - TRV state changes during cooldown (with solution)
  - Sensor update delay after state changes (10 second rule)
  - Minimum boiler runtime protection (buffer radiators)
  - Predictive shutdown timing (0.3°C threshold)
  - Adaptive cooldown duration based on runtime
  - Multiple trigger automations for reliability
  - State tracking with input helpers
  - Buffer radiators coordination
  - System enable/disable transitions
  - Periodic check as safety net
- **Climate Control section in AI Instructions:**
  - Mandatory checklist for TRV/boiler automations
  - Critical edge cases to handle
  - Required sensors and helpers
  - Core automations (Priority 1, 2, 3)
  - Timing guidelines
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  - Testing checklist

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive climate control best practices based on production testing
- Real-world performance data (7+ days continuous operation)
- Architecture patterns for state-based automations

- Saves debugging time by implementing solutions from day one
- Applicable to other automation systems beyond climate control

## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **AI-controlled reload workflow:** Files API no longer auto-reloads after writes
  - Safer: AI must explicitly check config validity before reload
  - Faster: Batch multiple changes → single reload at the end
  - More control: AI decides when to reload based on change scope

### Added
- **Comprehensive modification workflow in AI Instructions:**
  - 6-step process: Backup → Write → Check → Reload → Verify → Commit
  - Configuration validation before reload (prevents broken HA state)
  - Rollback guidance if validation fails
  - Example workflows for common scenarios

### Fixed
- **Safety improvement:** Removed automatic reload that could apply invalid configurations
- **Performance:** No more multiple reloads when making batch changes

### Changed
- Improved MCP client logs handling with proper parameter names (limit, level)
- Updated tool descriptions for better clarity

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Token validation in add-on mode:** Fixed "Invalid token" errors when using Long-Lived Access Tokens
- Agent no longer tries to validate user tokens through supervisor URL (which doesn't accept them)
- In add-on mode, agent simply checks that a token is provided and uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN for HA API operations

### Changed
- Simplified token validation logic for better reliability
- Improved token validation logging

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **Enhanced debugging:** Detailed logging for token configuration at startup
