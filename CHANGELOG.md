### 🚀 API-based automation & script management + Security fix

**Breaking the file structure barrier: Now works with ALL automations and scripts, regardless of where they live**

#### The Problem We Solved

Previously, the agent could only see and manage automations and scripts that were stored in the traditional `automations.yaml` and `scripts.yaml` files. This created a frustrating limitation for users with mature Home Assistant setups:

- **Users with packages**: If you organized your config using `packages/*.yaml` files (a common practice for larger installations), the agent couldn't see those automations/scripts
- **UI-created automations**: Automations created through Home Assistant's web interface are stored in `.storage` and were completely invisible to the agent
- **Mixed setups**: Many users have a mix of file-based and UI-created automations, but the agent could only work with the file-based ones

**Real-world impact**: A user reported having 159 automations in their system, but the agent could only see 4 of them (the ones in `automations.yaml`). The other 155 automations were invisible and unmanageable through the agent.

#### The Solution

We've completely rebuilt how the agent interacts with automations and scripts. Instead of reading and writing YAML files directly, the agent now uses Home Assistant's official WebSocket API (`config/automation/list`, `config/script/list`, etc.). This means:

- ✅ **See everything**: `list_automations` and `list_scripts` now return ALL automations/scripts that Home Assistant knows about, regardless of where they're stored:
  - From `automations.yaml` / `scripts.yaml` (traditional files)
  - From `packages/*.yaml` files (organized configs)
  - Created via UI (stored in `.storage`)
- ✅ **Get individual items**: You can now fetch a specific automation or script by ID using `get_automation` or `get_script`, without loading entire YAML files
- ✅ **List IDs only**: Both endpoints support `ids_only=true` parameter to get just a list of IDs without full configurations, saving tokens and context
- ✅ **Create/update/delete via API**: All write operations now go through Home Assistant's API, so they work regardless of your file structure
- ✅ **Smart Git versioning**: After each operation, the agent exports the current state of all automations/scripts to Git in `export/automations/<id>.yaml` and `export/scripts/<id>.yaml` format, creating a complete history
- ✅ **Intelligent rollback**: When rolling back to a previous Git commit, the agent detects exported automations/scripts and applies them via API, ensuring consistent restoration
- ✅ **Backwards compatible**: Old Git commits (without the export/ structure) still work via file-based rollback, so your existing backups remain functional

**Result**: That user with 159 automations? Now all 159 are visible and manageable. No more file structure limitations.

#### Security Fix (from PR #22)

- ✅ **Secure API key regeneration**: The `/api/regenerate-key` endpoint now requires authentication (valid API key in `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header) to prevent unauthorized key regeneration from arbitrary web pages. Previously, any website could call this endpoint and regenerate your API key without authentication, creating a critical security vulnerability. The UI still works seamlessly by passing the current key in the request header when regenerating keys.

## [2.10.12] - 2026-01-20

### ✨ Device entity discovery & expanded IDE support

**Better device understanding and setup options for more IDEs**

- ✅ **Device entity discovery**: `/api/registries/devices/{device_id}` now supports `include_entities=true` parameter to return all entities belonging to a device with their descriptions (entity_id, friendly_name, domain, device_class, current state) — perfect for understanding what sensors, switches, and other entities a physical device provides
- ✅ **VS Code + Codex support**: Added new setup tab with TOML configuration for OpenAI Codex extension in VS Code, using `~/.codex/config.toml` format (based on user feedback)
- ✅ **Claude Code integration**: Added new setup tab (2nd position) with support for both CLI command (`claude mcp add`) and manual configuration via `~/.claude.json` or `.mcp.json`
- ✅ **Enhanced device registry responses**: When `include_entities=true`, device responses include enriched entity information sorted by domain, making it easy for AI to understand device capabilities

## [2.10.11] - 2026-01-20

### 🔧 Fix: VS Code + Copilot configuration format

- ✅ **Configuration format correction**: Reverted VS Code + Copilot setup to use `mcp.json` (JSON format) as originally designed, maintaining compatibility with existing setups

## [2.10.10] - 2026-01-20

### ✨ LLM-friendly entity listing & YAML safety checks

**Safer, more efficient workflows for large installations and YAML edits**

- ✅ **Token-efficient entity listing**: `/api/entities/list` now supports pagination (`page`, `page_size=250`) and lightweight modes so AI tools never have to dump thousands of full entity states at once
- ✅ **IDs-only & summary modes**: New `ids_only=true` returns just a list of `entity_id` strings, and `summary_only=true` returns compact objects (`entity_id`, `state`, `domain`, `friendly_name`) — ideal for discovering what exists without overloading model context
- ✅ **YAML syntax validation on write/append**: All writes to `*.yaml`/`*.yml` via `/api/files/write` and `/api/files/append` are now validated with `yaml.safe_load` before saving, preventing broken YAML from ever hitting `/config`
- ✅ **Duplicate automation ID protection**: For `automations.yaml`, the agent now detects duplicate `id` values when writing/appending and rejects the change with a clear error message, helping avoid subtle HA behaviour caused by duplicated automations

## [2.10.9] - 2026-01-20

### ✨ Token‑efficient access to scripts and automations

**Focused YAML access to save tokens and speed up AI workflows**

- ✅ **Lightweight listing endpoints**: Added support for listing script IDs and automation IDs without returning full YAML bodies, so AI tools can cheaply discover what exists before deciding what to open
- ✅ **Single‑entity configuration fetch**: New read‑only endpoints return configuration for a single script or automation by its ID, instead of loading entire `scripts.yaml` / `automations.yaml`
- ✅ **Token and context savings**: Designed specifically to reduce prompt/context size and token usage when working with large YAML files, especially in conversational AI scenarios
- ✅ **Faster request handling**: By focusing responses on the one script/automation you are currently working with, the agent can answer faster and IDEs can keep conversations narrow and relevant

## [2.10.8] - 2025-12-18

### 🔧 Git Versioning: Auto/Manual Mode & Shadow Repository

**New Git Versioning Mode:**
- ✅ **Replaced `auto_backup` with `git_versioning_auto`**: More descriptive configuration option
- ✅ **Automatic mode (`git_versioning_auto=true`)**: Commits happen automatically after each operation (default behavior)
- ✅ **Manual mode (`git_versioning_auto=false`)**: Changes are synced to shadow repo but not committed until user explicitly requests via `/api/backup/commit`

**Enhanced Commit API:**
- ✅ **Smart commit endpoint**: `/api/backup/commit` now supports:
  - With `message`: Commits immediately
  - Without `message` in manual mode: Returns suggested commit message (does not commit)
  - AI can show suggestion to user, allow editing, then commit with final message
- ✅ **New `/api/backup/pending` endpoint**: Get information about uncommitted changes (files modified/added/deleted, summary, diff)
- ✅ **Commit message generation**: Automatic generation of commit messages based on file changes (automations, scripts, dashboards, themes, etc.)

**Shadow Repository Architecture:**
- ✅ **Isolated Git operations**: All Git operations now happen in `/config/ha_vibecode_git` shadow repository
- ✅ **No interference with user's Git**: Agent never touches `/config/.git`, preserving user's GitHub remotes and history
- ✅ **Bidirectional sync**: Changes sync from `/config` to shadow repo before commits, and from shadow repo back to `/config` during rollback/restore

**Critical Operations Always Commit:**
- ✅ **Rollback**: Always commits "Before rollback" state (force=True)
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Always commits "Pre-cleanup" state (force=True)
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Always commits checkpoint state (force=True)

**Updated Files:**
- `config.yaml`: `auto_backup` → `git_versioning_auto`
- `run.sh`: Updated environment variables
- `GitManager`: New `git_versioning_auto` logic, `get_pending_changes()`, `_generate_commit_message_from_changes()`
- All API endpoints: Updated to use `git_versioning_auto` instead of `auto_backup`

## [2.10.7] - 2025-12-18

### 🐛 HACS Repositories Access Fix & Improvements

**Fixed HACS repositories list functionality for HACS 2.0+**

- ✅ **Fixed repository listing**: Changed from reading `sensor.hacs_*` entities (not available in HACS 2.0) to reading `/config/.storage/hacs.repositories` file directly
- ✅ **Corrected data structure parsing**: Fixed parsing to read repositories from `data` object directly (not `data.repositories`)
- ✅ **Fixed field mappings**: Corrected field names to match HACS storage format:
  - `version_installed` instead of `installed_version`
  - `stargazers_count` instead of `stars`
- ✅ **Enhanced repository information**: Now extracts full repository details including name, category, versions, stars, downloads, and descriptions

**Improved installation and update functions:**

- ✅ **Installation verification**: Added automatic verification by checking storage file after repository installation
- ✅ **Version tracking**: Added tracking of repository versions before `update_all` operation for comparison
- ✅ **Enhanced logging**: Improved logging for better diagnostics (verification status, repository counts, WebSocket results)
- ✅ **Detailed API responses**: Functions now return detailed status information including:
  - Installation verification status
  - List of repositories with versions before update
  - WebSocket service call results
  - Next steps guidance

**Technical improvements:**

- ✅ **Better error handling**: Graceful handling of JSON parsing errors and missing storage files
- ✅ **Fallback mechanisms**: Added fallback to alternative data structures if primary structure not found
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging**: Added debug and info logs throughout the process for troubleshooting

## [2.10.5] - 2025-12-09

### ✨ Registry Management & Dead Entity Detection

**New Features:**

- ✅ **Dead Entity Detection**: New `/api/registries/entities/dead` endpoint finds automations and scripts that exist in Entity Registry but are missing from YAML files
  
- ✅ **Automatic Registry Cleanup**: When deleting automations or scripts via API, corresponding Entity Registry entries are automatically removed

- ✅ **Area Registry Operations**: Full support for creating, updating, and deleting areas via API

- ✅ **Device Registry Operations**: Full support for removing devices from Device Registry via API

**Registry API Coverage:**
- Entity Registry: list, get, update, remove
- Area Registry: list, get, create, update, delete
- Device Registry: list, get, update, remove
- Dead Entity Detection: compare registry with YAML files

## [2.10.4] - 2025-12-06

### ✨ Redesigned Git Versioning & Backup System

**Automatic backup system with AI-powered change descriptions**

The built-in Git versioning and backup system has been completely redesigned. Now, every time you modify scripts, dashboards, and configuration files, the agent automatically saves changes to the onboard Git repository and allows you to easily rollback to any previous version.

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ **AI-generated change descriptions**: The agent now uses AI to create meaningful descriptions of what changed and why (e.g., "Add automation: Control lights when motion detected")
- ✅ **Easy change history**: You can ask AI to show a list of recent changes and quickly find what you need
- ✅ **Smart rollback**: Simply describe what you want to rollback to (e.g., "rollback to when I added the motion sensor automation") and AI will find and restore it

**Bug fix:**
- ✅ **Fixed backup size issue**: Previously, large database or media files could accidentally be included in Git backups, causing rapid repository growth. Now only configuration files, scripts, automations, and dashboards are tracked in Git, keeping backups small and efficient.

## [2.10.1] - 2025-12-06

### 🐛 CRITICAL BUGFIX: Git Backup Size Issue

**Fixed massive backup size increase caused by Git repository including large files**

- ✅ **Automatic `.gitignore` creation**: Git repository now automatically creates `.gitignore` file in `/config` directory to exclude large files
- ✅ **Excluded large files from Git**: Database files (`.db`, `.db-shm`, `.db-wal`), logs, media files, and Home Assistant internal directories are now automatically excluded
- ✅ **Smart file tracking**: Only configuration files (YAML, JSON) are tracked in Git, preventing backup size bloat
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup of tracked files**: When `.gitignore` is created, already tracked large files are automatically removed from Git index (but kept on disk)
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing Git repositories are updated with `.gitignore` on next initialization

**What was fixed:**
- Previously, `git add -A` was adding ALL files from `/config`, including:
  - SQLite database files (can be several GB)
  - Log files
  - Media files (`/www/`, `/media/`)
  - Home Assistant internal storage (`.storage/`, `.homeassistant/`)
- This caused backup size to increase from ~1GB to 10-14GB after using the agent
- Now only configuration files are tracked, keeping backup size minimal

**Impact:**
- New installations: Problem completely resolved
- Existing installations: `.gitignore` will be created automatically, and already tracked large files will be removed from Git index, preventing future large files from being added
- Note: Existing Git history may still contain large files - consider cleaning Git history if needed (using `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo`)

**Technical details:**
- `.gitignore` is automatically created/updated when Git repository is initialized
- Excludes: `*.db`, `*.log`, `/www/`, `/media/`, `/.storage/`, `/.homeassistant/`, and other large file patterns
- Git operations now respect `.gitignore`, ensuring only config files are versioned

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-06

## [2.9.17] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Indentation Error in Helpers Delete Function

- ✅ Fixed IndentationError in `app/api/helpers.py` delete helper function
- ✅ Corrected try-except block indentation
- ✅ Agent should now start correctly

## [2.9.16] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Automatic Checkpoint System for Git Versioning

**Consistent checkpoint creation at the start of each user request**

- ✅ Added `create_checkpoint()` method to GitManager - creates commit with tag at request start
- ✅ Added `/api/backup/checkpoint` endpoint for creating checkpoints
- ✅ Added `ha_create_checkpoint` and `ha_end_checkpoint` MCP tools
- ✅ Disabled auto-commits during request processing (prevents micro-commits)
- ✅ Checkpoints include timestamp tag (e.g., `checkpoint_20251123_194530`)
- ✅ Updated all `commit_changes()` calls to skip during request processing
- ✅ Updated AI instructions to automatically create checkpoint at request start
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.6

**How it works:**
1. At the start of each user request, `ha_create_checkpoint()` is called
2. Creates a commit with current state (if there are changes)
3. Creates a tag with timestamp and user request description
4. Disables auto-commits during request processing
5. All changes within the request are made without intermediate commits
6. At the end, `ha_end_checkpoint()` re-enables auto-commits

**Benefits:**
- Clean git history - one checkpoint per user request instead of many micro-commits
- Easy rollback - each checkpoint is tagged with timestamp and description
- Better organization - each user request is a logical unit in git history

**Example:**
```
User: "Create nice_dark theme"
→ ha_create_checkpoint("Create nice_dark theme")
→ Creates tag: checkpoint_20251123_194530
→ Makes all changes (no intermediate commits)
→ ha_end_checkpoint()
```

## [2.9.15] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Theme Management API & MCP Tools

**Complete theme management functionality for Home Assistant**

- ✅ Added `/api/themes` endpoints: list, get, create, update, delete, reload, check_config
- ✅ Added theme management methods to HA client
- ✅ Added 7 MCP tools for theme management:
  - `ha_list_themes` - List all available themes
  - `ha_get_theme` - Get theme content and configuration
  - `ha_create_theme` - Create a new theme
  - `ha_update_theme` - Update an existing theme
  - `ha_delete_theme` - Delete a theme
  - `ha_reload_themes` - Reload themes in Home Assistant
  - `ha_check_theme_config` - Check if themes are configured
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.5

**Use Cases:**
- Create custom themes with CSS variables
- Manage themes programmatically via AI
- Check theme configuration status
- Reload themes without restarting HA

**Example:**
```yaml
nice_dark:
  primary-color: "#ffb74d"
  accent-color: "#ffb74d"
  primary-background-color: "#101018"
  card-background-color: "#181824"
  ha-card-border-radius: "18px"
  ...
```

## [2.9.14] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 FIX: Entity Rename via WebSocket API

**Fixed 404 error when renaming entities**

- ✅ Changed entity rename from REST API to WebSocket API (`config/entity_registry/update`)
- ✅ Added support for optional `new_name` parameter to update friendly name
- ✅ Fixed "404 Not Found" error when renaming entities

**Technical Details:**
- Home Assistant Entity Registry updates must be done via WebSocket API, not REST
- REST endpoint `/api/config/entity_registry/update/{entity_id}` doesn't exist
- WebSocket command `config/entity_registry/update` is the correct method

## [2.9.13] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Entity Rename Functionality

- ✅ Added `/api/entities/rename` endpoint to rename entity_id via Entity Registry API
- ✅ Added `renameEntity` method to HA client
- ✅ Added `ha_rename_entity` MCP tool for renaming entities through AI
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.4

**Use Cases:**
- Rename entities to more descriptive names (e.g., `climate.sonoff_trvzb_thermostat` → `climate.office_trv_thermostat`)
- Standardize entity naming conventions across Home Assistant
- Automate entity renaming workflows

## [2.9.12] - 2025-11-21

### ✨ NEW: Logbook API & MCP Tool

- ✅ Added `/api/logbook` endpoint with rich filtering (time window, domains, entities, event types, search)
- ✅ Added summary statistics for scripts/automations to quickly inspect recent runs
- ✅ Updated MCP client, handlers, and tool schema with `ha_logbook_entries`
- ✅ Documented new capability and expanded HA agent test suite to cover logbook operations

## [2.9.11] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 FIX: Entity Registry Result Format Handling

**Handle both wrapped and direct entity registry result formats**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed parsing of entity registry result - API can return data directly or wrapped in `{'result': ...}`
- ✅ Code now handles both formats correctly
- ✅ Allows deletion to proceed for all helpers

**Technical Details:**
- WebSocket API `config/entity_registry/get` can return data in two formats:
  - Wrapped: `{'result': {...}}`
  - Direct: `{...}`
- Code now checks for both formats and extracts entry data correctly

## [2.9.10] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 FIX: Syntax Error in Entity Registry Deletion

**Fixed try-except block indentation**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed syntax error: `except` block was incorrectly nested inside `if state:` block
- ✅ Moved `except` to correct level to match `try` block
- ✅ Code now compiles correctly

## [2.9.9] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Comprehensive Helper Deletion Strategy

**Delete helpers from all possible locations: YAML, config entry, and entity registry**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Always check and delete from YAML first (if helper exists there)
- ✅ Then try config entry deletion (for storage helpers)
- ✅ Then try entity registry deletion via WebSocket (even if YAML deletion succeeded)
- ✅ This ensures we delete everywhere possible, including restored entities
- ✅ Better logging to show which methods were used

**Technical Details:**
- YAML deletion: removes from YAML file and reloads integration
- Config entry deletion: finds and deletes config entry for storage helpers
- Entity registry deletion: removes from entity registry via WebSocket (works for all helpers)
- For restored entities: deletion from entity registry may work temporarily even after YAML removal

## [2.9.8] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: WebSocket Deletion for All Helpers

**Attempt WebSocket deletion for all helpers, not just storage helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Try entity registry removal via WebSocket for all helpers (YAML-managed and storage)
- ✅ YAML-managed helpers may be deleted temporarily (will restore on restart if still in YAML)
- ✅ Storage helpers will be permanently deleted
- ✅ Better logging to distinguish between YAML-managed and storage helpers
- ✅ Clear warnings when YAML-managed helpers are deleted (may restore)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `config/entity_registry/remove` WebSocket API for all helpers
- YAML-managed helpers: deletion may work temporarily but will restore if still in YAML
- Storage helpers: permanent deletion via entity registry

## [2.9.7] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 FIX: YAML-Managed Helper Deletion Detection

**Properly detect and handle YAML-managed helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Check if helper is YAML-managed (config_entry_id = None in entity registry)
- ✅ Return clear error message for YAML-managed helpers (cannot be deleted via API)
- ✅ Only attempt entity registry deletion for storage helpers (created via UI)
- ✅ Better error messages explaining that YAML helpers must be removed from YAML files

**Technical Details:**
- YAML-managed helpers have `config_entry_id = None` in entity registry
- These helpers cannot be deleted via API - they must be removed from YAML and HA restarted
- Storage helpers (created via UI) can be deleted via `config/entity_registry/remove`

## [2.9.6] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 DEBUG: Enhanced Entity Registry Deletion Logging

**Added detailed logging for entity registry deletion debugging**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added debug logging for entity registry get/remove operations
- ✅ Better error messages with exception details
- ✅ Logs registry entry data and API responses

## [2.9.5] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion for Restored Entities

**Added support for deleting restored helpers via entity registry**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added entity registry deletion for restored entities
- ✅ Handles helpers with `restored: true` attribute
- ✅ Uses `config/entity_registry/remove` API for cleanup
- ✅ Supports deletion of helpers that were removed from config but still exist in database

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers that were removed from YAML but restored by Home Assistant
- Clean up orphaned entities from entity registry
- Complete cleanup of obsolete helpers

## [2.9.4] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion Logic

**Enhanced config entry deletion with multiple matching strategies**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Improved config entry search with multiple matching strategies:
  - Match by title (common for UI-created helpers)
  - Match by entity_id in options
  - Match by entry details (deep search)
- ✅ Added debug logging for config entry search process
- ✅ Better error messages when helper exists but can't be deleted
- ✅ More robust handling of config-entry-based helpers

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `config/config_entries/get` API to get detailed entry information
- Tries multiple matching strategies before giving up
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

## [2.9.3] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion

**Enhanced helper deletion to support config entry helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` now attempts to delete helpers created via UI/API (config entries)
- ✅ First tries YAML deletion (if helper exists in YAML)
- ✅ Then tries config entry deletion (if helper was created via UI/API)
- ✅ Better error messages when helper cannot be deleted automatically

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers created via `ha_create_helper` MCP tool
- Delete helpers created manually via Home Assistant UI
- Clean up obsolete helpers from configuration

## [2.9.2] - 2025-11-18

### ✨ NEW: Service Call API Endpoint

**Added API endpoint for calling Home Assistant services**

**New Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/entities/call_service` - Call any Home Assistant service

**Features:**
- ✅ Call any Home Assistant service via REST API
- ✅ Support for service_data and target parameters
- ✅ Proper parameter merging (target fields merged into service_data)
- ✅ Full error handling and logging

**Parameters:**
- `domain` (required) - Service domain (e.g., "number", "light", "climate")
- `service` (required) - Service name (e.g., "set_value", "turn_on", "set_temperature")
- `service_data` (optional) - Service-specific data
- `target` (optional) - Target entity/entities

**Examples:**
```json
// Set number value
{
  "domain": "number",
  "service": "set_value",
  "service_data": {
    "entity_id": "number.alex_trv_local_temperature_offset",
    "value": -2.0
  }
}

// Turn on light
{
  "domain": "light",
  "service": "turn_on",
  "target": {"entity_id": "light.living_room"}
}

// Set climate temperature
{
  "domain": "climate",
  "service": "set_temperature",
  "target": {"entity_id": "climate.bedroom_trv_thermostat"},
  "service_data": {"temperature": 21.0}
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Configure device parameters (TRV offsets, limits, etc.)
- Control devices (lights, switches, climate)
- Update helper values
- Any Home Assistant service call

**Integration:**
- Used by MCP tool `ha_call_service`
- Enables AI to call services directly
- Full integration with existing ha_client.call_service method

## [2.9.1] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 FIX: Separate YAML files for each helper type

**Problem in v2.9.0:**
- All helper domains (input_boolean, input_text, etc.) referenced same file `helpers.yaml`
- This caused conflicts - each domain tried to load entire file
- Helpers not appearing after reload

**Solution:**
- Each domain now has its own file:
  - `input_boolean.yaml`
  - `input_text.yaml`
  - `input_number.yaml`
  - `input_datetime.yaml`
  - `input_select.yaml`
- Clean configuration.yaml references:
  ```yaml
  input_boolean: !include input_boolean.yaml
  input_text: !include input_text.yaml
  # ... etc
  ```

**Now helpers ACTUALLY work!** 🎉

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-11

### 🎉 MAJOR: Helper Creation via YAML Now Works!

**Breaking Discovery:** Helpers CAN be created via API using YAML + reload method!

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Write helper config to `helpers.yaml`
- ✅ Automatically include `helpers.yaml` in `configuration.yaml`
- ✅ Call `input_*.reload` service to apply changes
- ✅ Helper appears immediately without HA restart

**New Method:**
```python
# 1. Add to helpers.yaml:
input_boolean:
  my_switch:
    name: "My Switch"
    icon: "mdi:toggle-switch"

# 2. Reload integration:
await ws_client.call_service('input_boolean', 'reload', {})

# 3. Helper is now available!
```

**API Changes:**
- ✅ `POST /api/helpers/create` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ Automatic entity_id generation from name
- ✅ Git commits for all helper changes
- ✅ Validation and error handling

**What Changed:**
- Moved from `.storage/` approach (doesn't work) to YAML approach (works!)
- Helpers created via API are now YAML-based (editable in UI and files)
- Full CRUD support for all helper types

**Credit:** Solution discovered via Home Assistant Community forums

## [2.7.7] - 2025-11-11

### 🚨 Critical: Added Explicit Ban on `attribute:` in Conditional Cards

**MAJOR UPDATE: Found and fixed critical mistake pattern in AI instructions**

**The Problem:**
AI was generating invalid conditional cards with `attribute:` key:
```yaml
# ❌ This was being generated (DOES NOT WORK!)
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    attribute: hvac_action    # ← Lovelace does NOT support this!
    state: heating
```

**Root Cause:**
- Lovelace conditional cards do NOT support `attribute:` key
- Home Assistant automations DO support `attribute:` (confusion!)
- AI instructions didn't explicitly forbid this pattern

**What Was Added:**

1. **🚨 CRITICAL warning section** at document start
2. **Expanded Mistake #4** with multiple wrong examples
3. **Updated Golden Rules** - moved `attribute:` ban to #1
4. **Explanation of automation vs dashboard syntax difference**

**New Structure:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Use template sensor
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Office TRV HVAC Action"
        state: "{{ state_attr('climate.xxx', 'hvac_action') }}"

# Then in dashboard:
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Impact:**
- AI will never use `attribute:` in Lovelace conditionals
- Clear explanation why (automation vs dashboard difference)
- Template sensor pattern shown as solution
- Fixed actual broken dashboard in Home Assistant (commit 3bee434b)

**Files Updated:**
- `06_conditional_cards.md` - Added explicit ban and examples
- Home Assistant `heating-now.yaml` - Fixed all 7 TRV conditionals

**Version:** 2.7.7 (PATCH - critical documentation fix)

## [2.7.6] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 Fix: Conditional Cards Guide - Corrected Structure

**Fixed incorrect conditional card patterns in AI instructions**

**What was wrong in v2.7.5:**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Missing "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    state: "heat"
```

**Corrected in v2.7.6:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Must include "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Key fixes:**
1. ✅ Added `condition: state` requirement (most common mistake!)
2. ✅ Corrected to use template sensors for hvac_action attributes
3. ✅ Fixed state value: `heating` not "heat"
4. ✅ Added `condition: numeric_state` for numeric comparisons
5. ✅ Updated all examples with correct structure
6. ✅ Based on actual working commit: e8ed8a3b

**Reference:** Commit e8ed8a3b - "Before deleting dashboard: heating-now.yaml" (the working version)

**Impact:**
- AI will now generate correct conditional cards
- Prevents common YAML structure mistakes
- Template sensors properly documented
- Real-world tested patterns

**Version:** 2.7.6 (PATCH - documentation fix)

## [2.7.4] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Git Rollback Endpoint

**Fixed 404 error when rolling back via MCP tools**

**Bug:**
- MCP calls: `POST /api/backup/rollback/{commit_hash}` (path param)
- API expected: `POST /api/backup/rollback` + body
- Result: 404 Not Found

**Fix:**
- Added path parameter endpoint: `/rollback/{commit_hash}`
- Kept body parameter endpoint for compatibility
- Both versions now work

**API Endpoints:**
```
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback/abc123 (path param - for MCP)
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback + body (legacy - for direct API calls)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Git rollback works from AI
- ✅ Can restore previous configurations
- ✅ Both calling styles supported

**Version:** 2.7.4 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.3] - 2025-11-10

### ✨ Feature: Dashboard Validation + Detailed Errors

**Comprehensive dashboard validation and better error reporting!**

**Part 1: Dashboard Filename Validation**
- Validates filename contains hyphen (HA requirement)
- Checks for spaces, uppercase
- Returns helpful suggestions
- Prevents common mistakes

**Validation Rules:**
```
❌ BAD:  "heating", "stat", "climate" (no hyphen)
✅ GOOD: "heating-now", "climate-control"

Auto-suggestions:
"stat" → "stat-dashboard"
"Heating Now" → "heating-now" (kebab-case)
```

**Part 2: Pre-Creation Checks**
- AI checks if dashboard already exists
- Warns before overwriting
- Validates filename before backup (fail fast)

**Part 3: Detailed Configuration Errors**
- check_config returns detailed errors like Developer Tools
- Shows line numbers and specific issues
- Extracts error messages from HA API
- Much better debugging

**AI Instructions Updated:**
- Added STEP 0: Pre-Creation Checks (mandatory)
- Dashboard name validation rules
- Examples and auto-conversion logic

**Before:**
```
Error: "Configuration has errors: 500 Server Error"
```

**After:**
```
Error: "Configuration invalid!

Invalid config for 'lovelace' at configuration.yaml, line 342: 
Url path needs to contain a hyphen (-) for dictionary value..."
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents invalid dashboard names
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ AI can understand and fix issues
- ✅ Fewer failed dashboard creations

**Version:** 2.7.3 (PATCH - validation improvements)

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: File List Root Directory

**Fixed 500 error when listing files with directory='/'**

**Bug:**
- `ha_list_files` with directory="/" failed
- Error: "Path outside config directory: /"
- AI couldn't browse config directory

**Root Cause:**
- _get_full_path() treated "/" as absolute path
- Security check failed

**Fix:**
- Handle "/" and "" as root config directory
- Strip leading slashes from paths
- Return config_path directly for root

**Impact:**
- ✅ AI can now browse config directory
- ✅ ha_list_files works correctly
- ✅ Security still enforced

**Version:** 2.7.2 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-10

## [2.3.14] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository Parsing Logic (Complete Fix):**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error for all Supervisor API response formats
- ✅ Handles 4 different response formats correctly
- ✅ No more `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` errors

**Root cause found:**
- Supervisor API returns: `{'data': [...list...]}`
- Old code: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories')`
- If `data` is list: `[...].get('repositories')` → ERROR!

**Complete fix - handles all formats:**
1. Direct list: `[...]`
2. Dict with repositories: `{'repositories': [...]}`
3. Dict with data as list: `{'data': [...]}`
4. Dict with nested data: `{'data': {'repositories': [...]}}`

**Impact:**
- Repository management now fully functional
- All Supervisor API response formats handled correctly

## [2.3.13] - 2025-11-09

### 🔍 Feature: MCP Client Version Tracking

**Added MCP version logging:**
- ✅ Middleware logs MCP client version on first request
- ✅ Reads X-MCP-Client-Version header from MCP client
- ✅ Shows: `🔌 MCP Client connected: v2.3.4 from 192.168.68.63`
- ✅ Logs once per client IP (avoids spam)

**Benefits:**
- See which MCP version is connecting
- Identify version mismatches
- Better debugging capabilities

## [2.3.12] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Maintenance

**Force Docker rebuild:**
- Version increment to trigger Home Assistant rebuild
- Ensures repository parsing fix is applied

## [2.3.11] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository List Parsing:**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error: `'list' object has no attribute 'get'`
- ✅ Added flexible parsing for Supervisor API response
- ✅ Handles both list and dict response formats

**What was wrong:**
- Code assumed: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories', [])`
- Supervisor API may return list directly or in different structure
- Caused error when listing repositories

**Fix:**
- Check if result is list → use directly
- Check if result is dict → handle multiple formats
- Fallback to empty list if unexpected format

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/repositories` now works correctly
- AI can check connected repositories
- AI can suggest adding community repositories

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: flexible parsing in list_repositories()

## [2.3.10] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Installed Add-ons Detection Logic:**
- ✅ Changed detection from `a.get('installed')` to `a.get('version')`
- ✅ Supervisor API returns `version` field for installed add-ons
- ✅ Field `installed` is not always present in response

**What was wrong:**
- Logic checked for `installed` field: `if a.get('installed')`
- Supervisor API doesn't always include this field
- Installed add-ons have `version` field (current installed version)
- Available (not installed) add-ons only have `version_latest`

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/available` now correctly separates installed vs available
- `/api/addons/installed` now shows actual installed add-ons
- AI can see which add-ons are already installed

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: changed filter logic in both endpoints
  - `list_available_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed
  - `list_installed_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed

## [2.3.9] - 2025-11-09

### 📚 Enhanced AI Instructions

**Improved Add-on Management Guidance:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive add-on reference guide with purpose and use cases
- ✅ Explained why popular add-ons may not appear (minimal repository setup)
- ✅ Removed hardcoded slugs - now dynamically searches add-ons by name
- ✅ Added instructions for users to add community repositories
- ✅ Detailed descriptions of popular add-ons:
  - Mosquitto MQTT Broker (IoT communication)
  - Zigbee2MQTT (Zigbee devices)
  - Node-RED (visual automation)
  - ESPHome (DIY devices)
  - Terminal & SSH (system access)
  - MariaDB (database)
  - DuckDNS/Let's Encrypt (remote access)

**New Use Cases:**
- "What add-ons do you recommend?" - AI suggests based on user needs
- "Why do I see so few add-ons?" - AI explains minimal installation
- Dynamic slug discovery instead of hardcoded values

**Impact:**
- AI can now provide intelligent recommendations
- Users understand why certain add-ons aren't visible
- Better guidance for repository management
- Safer installations (no hardcoded slugs that may be wrong)

**Changes:**
- app/api/ai_instructions.py: 2.3.0 → 2.3.9
- Added 📋 Popular Add-ons Reference
- Added 🎯 Use Case templates
- Added ⚠️ Repository requirements explanation

## [2.3.8] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Fixed Supervisor API URL Path Duplication:**
- ✅ Removed `/supervisor/` prefix from all endpoint paths
- ✅ Fixed URL from `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now use correct URL format

**Root cause:**
- v2.3.4 added `/supervisor/` prefix to endpoints
- But `base_url` is already `http://supervisor`
- Result: `http://supervisor` + `/supervisor/addons` = double `/supervisor/` → 404

**Fixed all endpoints:**
- `addons` (not `supervisor/addons`)
- `addons/{slug}/info`, `/logs`, `/install`, `/uninstall`, etc.
- `store/repositories` (not `supervisor/store/repositories`)

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work with correct URLs!
- Manager role from v2.3.7 + correct URLs = working add-on management

## [2.3.7] - 2025-11-09

### 🔐 Critical Fix: Supervisor API Access + Security

**1. Added Supervisor Manager Role (Critical):**
- ✅ Added `hassio_role: manager` to config.yaml
- ✅ Grants add-on permissions to manage other add-ons via Supervisor API
- ✅ Fixes 403 Forbidden errors for all add-on management operations

**Root cause of 403 errors:**
- Supervisor API requires `hassio_role: manager` for add-on management
- Without this role, all Supervisor API calls return 403 Forbidden
- `hassio_api: true` alone is not sufficient for add-on management

**2. Security Fix: Removed Token Logging:**
- ✅ Removed token preview from all logs
- ✅ Changed from `Token: 7e2dec72...` to no token logging
- ✅ Headers logging moved to DEBUG level

**Why:**
- Logging tokens (even preview) is a security risk
- Tokens should never appear in logs accessible to users
- Debug-level logging available if needed for troubleshooting

**Changes:**
- config.yaml: added `hassio_role: manager`
- app/main.py: removed token from SupervisorClient startup log
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: removed token from all logs

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work correctly!
- 🔐 No token information in logs (improved security)

## [2.3.6] - 2025-11-09

### 🔍 Debug Enhancement

**Enhanced Supervisor API Logging:**
- ✅ Added detailed logging for Supervisor API requests
- ✅ Log exact URL, headers, and token (preview) for each request
- ✅ Added SupervisorClient initialization log in startup event

**Purpose:**
- Debug 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Verify correct URL format and authentication headers
- Identify root cause of add-on management issues

**Changes:**
- app/main.py: added SupervisorClient logging in startup event
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: enhanced request logging (INFO level)
- Logs now show: URL, headers, token preview for debugging

## [2.3.5] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Supervisor API Authentication Fix (Critical):**
- ✅ Fixed authentication header for Supervisor API
- ✅ Changed from `Authorization: Bearer {token}` to `X-Supervisor-Token: {token}`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now authenticate correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Supervisor API uses custom `X-Supervisor-Token` header, not standard `Authorization: Bearer`
- All requests were rejected with 403 Forbidden due to incorrect auth header
- Home Assistant Supervisor API documentation specifies `X-Supervisor-Token` format

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now work correctly ✅
- Authentication passes, full add-on lifecycle management functional
- Fixes 403 Forbidden errors from v2.3.4

**2. Logs Endpoint Redirect Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed unnecessary 307 redirect for `/api/logs` endpoint
- ✅ Changed `@router.get("/")` to `@router.get("")` in logs.py
- ✅ Direct response without redirect

**What was wrong:**
- Endpoint was defined as `/api/logs/` (with trailing slash)
- Requests to `/api/logs` caused 307 redirect to `/api/logs/`
- FastAPI automatically redirects when trailing slash mismatch occurs

**Impact:**
- `/api/logs` now responds directly with 200 OK (no redirect)
- Improved API performance and cleaner request logs

## [2.3.4] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Supervisor API Endpoint Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed all Supervisor API endpoints to use correct `/supervisor/` prefix
- ✅ Changed from `http://supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- All endpoints were missing the `/supervisor/` prefix
- Resulted in 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Supervisor API requires: `http://supervisor/supervisor/{endpoint}`

**Fixed endpoints:**
- ✅ `supervisor/addons` (list all)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/info` (get info)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/logs` (get logs)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/install` (install)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/uninstall` (uninstall)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/start` (start)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/stop` (stop)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/restart` (restart)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/update` (update)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/options` (configure)
- ✅ `supervisor/store/repositories` (repositories)

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now return correct data instead of 403 errors
- Full add-on lifecycle management now functional ✅

## [2.3.3] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Router Prefix Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `/api/addons` prefix in `addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/addons", ...)` to `router = APIRouter()`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Prefix was defined both in `addons.py` AND `main.py`
- URLs became `/api/addons/api/addons/installed` → 404
- Other routers (files, hacs) correctly use no prefix in router definition

**Impact:**
- Fixes all add-on management endpoints returning 404
- `/api/addons/installed` now correctly maps to `/api/addons/installed` ✅

## [2.3.2] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Build Fix

**Force Docker Rebuild:**
- ✅ Added version comment to `Dockerfile` to break Docker cache
- ✅ Ensures all new files (addons.py, supervisor_client.py) are included in build
- ✅ Fixes 404 error for add-on management endpoints

**Why this fix:**
- Home Assistant was using cached Docker image from v2.3.0
- New files weren't being copied into the container
- Cache-busting comment forces full rebuild

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Critical Import Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed ImportError in `app/api/addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `from app.models import Response` to `from app.models.schemas import Response`
- ✅ Agent now starts correctly

**Impact:**
- Fixes agent startup failure in v2.3.0
- All add-on management features now work correctly

  - Old configurations with `HA_TOKEN` will **STOP WORKING**
  - Must update to `HA_AGENT_KEY` in mcp.json
  - Cleaner API without legacy code

### Migration Required

**If you're using `HA_TOKEN`:**
```json
// OLD (will not work):
{
  "env": {
    "HA_TOKEN": "your-key"
  }
}

// NEW (required):
{
  "env": {
    "HA_AGENT_KEY": "your-key"
  }
}
```

**How to migrate:**
1. Update add-on to v2.0.0
2. Update MCP to v2.0.0
3. Change `HA_TOKEN` → `HA_AGENT_KEY` in your mcp.json
4. Restart Cursor

- **Ingress enabled** - panel appears in sidebar as "API Key"
- **Panel icon** changed to `mdi:key-variant`
- Agent now uses dedicated API key instead of user's HA token
- Agent still uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN internally for HA API operations

### Security
- ✅ No more transmitting HA Long-Lived Token over network
- ✅ API key is independent from HA authentication
- ✅ Can regenerate key without affecting HA access
- ✅ Simpler security model

### Migration
